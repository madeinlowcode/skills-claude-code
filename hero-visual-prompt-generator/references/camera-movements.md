# Camera Movements for Hero Videos

## Primary Movements

### Push-In / Dolly Forward
**Description:** Camera moves toward subject, increasing intimacy and focus.
**Speed:** Slow (4-6 seconds), Medium (2-3 seconds)
**Best for:** Product reveals, building focus, emotional connection
**Keywords:** `slow push-in`, `gentle dolly forward`, `subtle camera advance`, `gradual approach`
**Feeling:** Draws viewer in, creates intimacy, builds anticipation

### Pull-Out / Dolly Back
**Description:** Camera retreats from subject, revealing context.
**Speed:** Slow to medium
**Best for:** Revealing environment, showing scale, ending shots
**Keywords:** `slow pull-out`, `revealing dolly back`, `widening perspective`
**Feeling:** Creates context, shows bigger picture, conclusion

### Orbital / Arc
**Description:** Camera moves in arc around stationary subject.
**Speed:** Slow (90-180 degrees over 4-6 seconds)
**Best for:** Product showcases, revealing design details, premium feel
**Keywords:** `smooth orbital movement`, `arcing around subject`, `180-degree orbit`, `circling camera`
**Feeling:** Showcases product from multiple angles, premium commercial feel

### Tracking / Lateral
**Description:** Camera moves sideways parallel to subject.
**Speed:** Slow to medium
**Best for:** Revealing elements, parallax effects, dynamic compositions
**Keywords:** `lateral tracking shot`, `side-to-side movement`, `horizontal slide`
**Feeling:** Reveals new information, creates parallax depth

### Crane / Vertical
**Description:** Camera moves up or down vertically.
**Speed:** Slow
**Best for:** Reveals, establishing shots, dramatic entrances
**Keywords:** `vertical crane movement`, `rising camera`, `descending reveal`
**Feeling:** Grand, cinematic, reveals from new perspective

## Subtle Movements (Hero Section Appropriate)

### Micro Push
**Description:** Almost imperceptible forward movement, creating "living" image feel.
**Speed:** Very slow (entire loop duration)
**Keywords:** `very subtle push-in`, `barely perceptible forward drift`, `breathing camera movement`
**Best for:** Hero sections that need subtle motion without distraction

### Gentle Float
**Description:** Tiny multi-directional drift creating organic feel.
**Speed:** Very slow, continuous
**Keywords:** `gentle floating camera`, `subtle organic drift`, `breathing movement`
**Best for:** Ambient hero backgrounds, lifestyle content

### Slow Zoom
**Description:** Optical zoom rather than physical movement, smooth focal length change.
**Speed:** Very slow
**Keywords:** `gradual zoom`, `slow focal length shift`, `smooth magnification`
**Best for:** Drawing attention to detail, subtle emphasis

## Combined Movements

### Push + Orbit
**Description:** Moving forward while arcing slightly.
**Keywords:** `push-in with subtle arc`, `advancing orbital movement`
**Effect:** Dynamic reveal with dimension

### Crane + Push
**Description:** Descending while moving forward.
**Keywords:** `descending push-in`, `crane down with forward movement`
**Effect:** Dramatic entrance, god's-eye to eye-level

### Track + Rise
**Description:** Moving laterally while rising.
**Keywords:** `rising lateral track`, `ascending side movement`
**Effect:** Complex reveal, premium commercial feel

## Timing Guidelines for Hero Videos

### 3-Second Hero Loop
- Single subtle movement (micro push OR gentle float)
- Movement should complete smoothly for seamless loop
- Avoid direction changes

### 4-5 Second Hero Video
- One primary movement (push, orbit, or track)
- Can include subtle secondary element movement
- Natural beginning and end points

### 6-8 Second Hero Video
- Can combine two movements (e.g., reveal + orbit)
- Room for transition between movements
- More complex choreography possible

## Movement Speed Descriptions

### Static with Living Elements
```
The camera remains stationary while [elements] float/drift subtly within frame.
```

### Very Slow (Ambient)
```
The camera performs an almost imperceptible [movement], creating a subtle living quality.
```

### Slow (Elegant)
```
The camera executes a slow, deliberate [movement] over [duration].
```

### Medium (Dynamic)
```
The camera smoothly [movement] at a measured pace, [additional detail].
```

### Fast (Energetic)
```
The camera [movement] with energy and momentum, [additional detail].
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Too fast for hero sections** - Hero videos need subtle, non-distracting movement
2. **Jarring direction changes** - Maintain smooth, predictable paths
3. **Fighting the composition** - Movement should enhance, not compete with product
4. **Ignoring loop points** - For looping heroes, end must match beginning
5. **Over-complicated paths** - Simple movements often more effective
