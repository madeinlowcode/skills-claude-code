Duration: 4-5 seconds

Aspect Ratio: [RATIO]
```

### Gravity Reveal
```
Sequence: Anti-gravity product reveal with floating elements.

Visuals:
- Start: Product resting on surface, subtle anticipation moment
- Middle: Product lifts off surface as if weightless, surrounding elements begin floating upward in layers, parallax depth between near and far elements
- End: Everything suspended in perfect anti-gravity composition, product as clear focal point

Lighting & Camera: Grounded lighting transforms to ethereal glow. Camera rises slowly with product.

Style: Dreamlike commercial videography, 4K, slow motion, soft focus on background elements.

Duration: 3-4 seconds

Aspect Ratio: [RATIO]
```

### Materialization
```
Sequence: Product materializes from particles/ingredients.

Visuals:
- Start: Scattered particles of [MATERIAL/INGREDIENTS] floating in void
- Middle: Particles begin gravitating toward center, forming shape of product, details becoming clearer
- End: Fully formed product with lingering particles orbiting gently

Lighting & Camera: Particles are backlit initially, lighting focuses and intensifies as product forms. Static camera with subtle zoom.

Style: Magical realism commercial, 4K, medium slow motion, sharp final product.

Duration: 4-5 seconds

Aspect Ratio: [RATIO]
```

## Dynamic Splash / Explosion

### Liquid Explosion
```
Sequence: High-speed liquid explosion around product.

Visuals:
- Start: Product centered in frame, tension moment of stillness
- Middle: Explosive outburst of [LIQUID] radiating from product in all directions, thousands of droplets suspended
- End: Frozen moment at peak explosion, product perfectly visible through liquid chaos

Lighting & Camera: Lighting intensifies with explosion, backlight through liquid droplets. High-speed capture effect, slight camera shake for impact.

Style: High-speed commercial photography in motion, 4K, extreme slow motion, ultra-sharp droplet detail.

Duration: 2-3 seconds

Aspect Ratio: [RATIO]
```

### Ingredient Burst
```
Sequence: Fresh ingredients burst outward revealing product.

Visuals:
- Start: Tight cluster of ingredients concealing product
- Middle: Ingredients explode outward in radial pattern, revealing product at center, each ingredient tumbling with natural physics
- End: Product revealed, ingredients floating at edges of frame

Lighting & Camera: Central lighting burst as ingredients separate. Camera static with slight push.

Style: Food commercial videography, 4K, slow motion, appetizing color grading.

Duration: 3-4 seconds

Aspect Ratio: [RATIO]
```

## Orbital / Rotation

### Product Orbit
```
Sequence: Camera orbits around static product with floating elements.

Visuals:
- Start: Product from front angle with suspended elements
- Middle: Smooth 90-180 degree orbit around product, floating elements maintain relative positions creating parallax
- End: New angle revealing different product details, elements still floating

Lighting & Camera: Lighting follows camera to maintain consistent product illumination. Smooth orbital camera path.

Style: Premium product showcase, 4K, real-time or slight slow motion, crisp focus throughout.

Duration: 4-6 seconds

Aspect Ratio: [RATIO]
```

### Rotating Product
```
Sequence: Product rotates to showcase design from all angles.

Visuals:
- Start: Product at rest, hero angle
- Middle: Smooth rotation revealing sides, back, details. Floating elements orbit in opposite direction
- End: Returns to hero angle or stops at secondary beauty shot

Lighting & Camera: Product is lit from multiple angles to look good throughout rotation. Static camera, product rotates on invisible axis.

Style: Technical product showcase, 4K, smooth motion, sharp detail.

Duration: 5-8 seconds

Aspect Ratio: [RATIO]
```

---

## Parallax / Depth

### Layered Parallax
```
Sequence: Multi-layer parallax creating depth and dimension.

Visuals:
- Start: Foreground, midground, background elements visible, product in midground
- Middle: Slow lateral or vertical camera movement creating parallax separation between layers
- End: New composition showing depth, product remains prominent

Lighting & Camera: Each layer lit to enhance separation. Slow tracking shot (lateral or vertical).

Style: Cinematic depth showcase, 4K, slow motion, selective focus.

Duration: 4-5 seconds

Aspect Ratio: [RATIO]
```

### Push Through
```
Sequence: Camera pushes through foreground elements to reveal product.

Visuals:
- Start: Foreground elements dominate frame, product visible but distant
- Middle: Camera pushes forward, foreground elements drift past with blur, product grows larger
- End: Product fills frame, foreground elements now behind camera

Lighting & Camera: Focus pulls from foreground to product during push. Slow dolly forward.

Style: Cinematic reveal, 4K, slow motion, dramatic focus shift.

Duration: 3-5 seconds

Aspect Ratio: [RATIO]
```

---

## Ambient / Mood

### Breathing Light
```
Sequence: Subtle light animation creating living, breathing feel.

Visuals:
- Start: Product in composed setting with [LIGHTING MOOD]
- Middle: Light slowly shifts, intensifies, or moves across product. Subtle element movement (floating particles, gentle drift)
- End: Light settles into slightly different mood, composition feels alive

Lighting & Camera: Main light source subtly animates (position, intensity, color). Static camera with possible very slow push.

Style: Atmospheric product mood piece, 4K, real-time, cinematic color grading.

Duration: 5-8 seconds

Aspect Ratio: [RATIO]
```

### Environment Transition
```
Sequence: Environment around product transforms while product stays constant.

Visuals:
- Start: Product in [ENVIRONMENT A]
- Middle: Environment dissolves, transforms, or shifts to [ENVIRONMENT B], product remains stable anchor
- End: Product in new environment, different mood

Lighting & Camera: Lighting transitions with environment change. Static camera, focus always on product.

Style: Magical/conceptual commercial, 4K, smooth transition, sharp product.

Duration: 4-6 seconds

Aspect Ratio: [RATIO]
```

## Mobile-Specific Adaptations

When adapting desktop prompts to mobile (9:16):

1. **Reframe composition** - Product may need vertical arrangement instead of horizontal
2. **Adjust element placement** - Supporting elements stack vertically rather than spread horizontally
3. **Consider scroll context** - Hero videos on mobile often appear in scroll contexts
4. **Emphasize vertical motion** - Upward or downward movements more natural than lateral
5. **Tighter crop on product** - Less room for wide environmental context

### Mobile Adaptation Example:
```
Desktop (16:9): Horizontal liquid splash with product center-left, ingredients spread wide
Mobile (9:16): Vertical liquid pour with product center, ingredients floating above and below in stacked composition
```
